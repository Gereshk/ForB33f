-   Aliases: gi

-   This command retrieves a single item from the operating system\
    Not in the same sense as double-clicking a file.\
    You\'ll just see the file or directory\'s metadata.

    -   Example: Get-Item \~/Desktop/myfile.txt

    -   This will return details about the item to stdout

        -   Note: the \~ symbol in the path just means \"the current logged in user (which is you)\"
