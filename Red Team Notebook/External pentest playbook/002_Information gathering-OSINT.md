Remember methodology is key, tools come and go

 

-   Hunting Breached Credentials

    -   First day or 2 of external pentest may be just research

    -   Credential stuffing/password spraying (common seasonal passwords, year, special character, company name, month, teams, locality, address - be creative)

    -   Breach-parse

    -   Dehashed.com (very large DB but expensive)

 

 

-   Identifying employees and emails

    -   Phonebook.cz

    -   Clearbit

    -   Hunter.io

    -   Linkedin

        -   If you know email convention you can convert things like employee name to first initial last name@

        -   Tools do exist for scraping linkedin but change frequently

    -   Can remove duplicates from lists in excel before spraying

 

 

-   Enumerating valid accounts (pre-attack)

    -   Check error messages on login portals or password resets

    -   Multiple login portals/pages

        -   Email

        -   Vpn

        -   SSO

        -   Customer

 

 

-   Other useful information

    -   Search websites for useful information

    -   Job postings

    -   System information

    -   Password policy

    -   Etc.
