-   Attack strategy

    -   Think of external pentests like home security

        -   most protection on outside, softer on the inside

    -   Low chance of RCE, high chance of weak passwords

        -   Lack of MFA

        -   Don\'t focus too much on webapp, can waste too much time

    -   OSINT is your best friend (and logical guessing)

 

 

-   Vulnerability scanning

    -   Nessus popular but pricey, companies will provide

        -   Make sure to look at options like malware

        -   Modify speed for very large networks

    -   Openvas open source

    -   [Programs - Bugcrowd](https://bugcrowd.com/programs)

        -   Verify for bug bounty and anything not under contract

 

 

-   Reviewing and extracting information

    -   Export nessus file and reporting pdf/html (custom)

    -   Nessus parser (others available)

        -   [Network Configuration Builders (melcara.com)](https://www.melcara.com/)

            -   Makes nice clickable excel report, good for porting to hacking sheet

        -   Think about making the info easy for you to sort through and easy for client
