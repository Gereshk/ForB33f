-   Should have already identified at this point

    -   Login portals to attack

    -   List of possible employees/emails

    -   Password strategies to employ

 

 

-   Attacking Office 365

    -   Ties in well with AD and passwords found may work for things like VPN also

    -   [GitHub - blacklanternsecurity/TREVORspray: TREVORspray is a modular password sprayer with threading, clever proxying, loot modules, and more!](https://github.com/blacklanternsecurity/TREVORspray)

        -   Example

        -   ![](003_Attacking_login_portals_000.png){width="12.697916666666666in" height="1.4375in"}

        -   Remember to check error we haven\'t seen yet, its not the same as invalid login

        -   Stop spraying if you see lockouts start to occur

    -   Spraying becoming more difficult in O365

    -   Office 365 alerts for valid users

    -   Create multiple instances in AWS EC2 to spray through (SSH first manually to accept fingerprint)

    -   Sensitive info can be inside all the O365 apps once you gain entry

 

 

-   Attacking OWA (Outlook web access) (on prem hosted)

    -   MSF good for spraying (OWA login option)

        -   Set pass and user file or user and pass file

        -   Low chance of getting blocked

        -   May need to change OWA version

        -   Will not auto stop for lockouts

 

 

-   Attacking other portals

    -   Burp pro best

 

 

-   Bypassing MFA

    -   Limited if social engineering not in scope

    -   [GitHub - dafthack/MFASweep: A tool for checking if MFA is enabled on multiple Microsoft Services](https://github.com/dafthack/MFASweep)

        -   Keep an eye out for mail sniper should work here
